You can execute the project by the following command in comment prompt/ IDE'S Terminal

Pre-Requisite: Every time restart the localhost mock service so that the test data that has been deleted, created will be reset.
Since this is just a mock project for now the data that has been verified had been hard-coded in the Feature file.

mvn clean install

Note:- You would require maven installed in your system
